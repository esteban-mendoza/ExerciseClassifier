# Random Forest Exercise Classifier

## Background

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl [[example video](https://youtu.be/YxtwA7XRK_g)] in five different fashions: 

1. exactly according to the specification (Class A), 
2. throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), 
3. lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), 
4. lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and 
5. throwing the hips to the front (Class E). 

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. 

A dataset was created from measurements of accelerometers placed on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of the participants. The complete details of the database can be found in the following link: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

## The project

The project implements a Random Forest predictor in R that determines the manner in which the exercise was performed, based on the measurements of the accelerometers. A report has been created that explains the process of building the model from the data and testing its performance.

A static rendered version of the final report can be found on https://esteban-mendoza.github.io/ExerciseClassifier/, while an executable R script containing the commented code can be found [here](https://github.com/esteban-mendoza/ExerciseClassifier/blob/master/report.r).
