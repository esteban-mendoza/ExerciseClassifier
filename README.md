# Exercise Classifier

The project implements a predictor in R that determines if an exercise is being properly performed or not, based on data from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

This project was created using Jupyter Notebooks. A static rendered version of the final report can be found on https://estebanmend.github.io/ExerciseClassifier/, while an executable R script containing the commented code can be found [here](https://github.com/estebanmend/ExerciseClassifier/blob/master/report.r).
